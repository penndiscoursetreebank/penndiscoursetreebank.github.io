PDTB API (0.2.9)
</H4>

<p>
This is an API to interact with the 
<a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb">Penn Discourse Treebank </a>, and
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank">Penn Treebank</a> annotations. It
provides:

<ul>

 <li> <a href="#browser">A Browser</a> - To browse and query the annotations,</li> 
 <li> <a href="Annotator.html">The Annotator</a> <IMAGE src="NewYellow3.gif" width="30" height="20" /> - To create annotations with the new file format (6/29/10 - Added support for Tamil and Japanese),</li> 
 <li> <a href="noptb.jar">A PTB-free Browser</a> <IMAGE src="NewYellow3.gif" width="30" height="20" /> - To view annotation files without the need for conversion or the PTB,</li> 
  <li> <a href="Conversion.html">A Conversion Tool</a> <IMAGE src="NewYellow3.gif" width="30" height="20" /> - To convert between the old and new file formats,</li> 
 <li> <a href="#xpathsupport">XPath support</a> -  To query the 
annotations programmatically, and</li>
 <li> <a href="#pdtbxpath">PDTBXPath</a> - A simple command line query interface to the PDTB</li>
</ul>

These are described below. See
<a href="pdtb-annotation-manual.pdf"> the PDTB User Manual </a> for terminology and
a description of the file formats expected. There are two distributions of 
this API:

<ol>
<li>
<a href="pdtbuser.zip"> The user distribution</a> - This should suffice for
all needs that don't involve modifying source. To run the browser (also 
avaliable as a Java&trade; Web Start application 
<a href="pdtbbrowser.jnlp">here</a>), download and unzip. Then:

<pre>
cd PDTBUser
java -jar pdtb.jar RawRoot PtbRoot PdtbRoot
</pre>

The locations RawRoot, PtbRoot, and PdtbRoot are described 
<a href="fileformat.pdf"> here </a>. Alternatively, run:

<pre>
cd PDTBUser
java -jar pdtb.jar
</pre>

And you will get "friendly" prompts for the directories. To program with it, 
see <a href="docs/index.html">API docs</a>.
<br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Older Distributions: <br/>
<a href="pdtbuser1.zip"> The PDTB1 user distribution</a><br/>
<a href="docs1/index.html"> The PDTB1 API docs</a>
<br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
<a href="pdtbdevel.zip"> The developer distribution</a> - If you need to
modify the source. It contains Lex and Yacc specifications which should be
reasonably easy to port for APIs in other languages. Also, if you have other
classes which you want the PDTB annotation deserialized into, the
Yacc specs will need to be modified. An
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> build script is included.
</li>
</ol>

By downloading this, you accept 
<a href="license/license.html"> the license</a>.
</p>

<p>
System requirements: Java&trade; 1.4.2. The API relies on Java&trade; for 
platform independence. However, the portability of component graphics is not
always seamless. We test mostly on Linux and marginally on Windows. Problems
on other platforms cannot be supported.
</p>

<p>
<b> Mac Users </b> - Pre 0.2.4 the bottom left window of the browser appears
garbled under the default look and feel (Aqua). This can be fixed without upgrading 
your version by running:

<pre>
cd PDTBUser
java -Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel -jar pdtb.jar
</pre>

Version 0.2.4 uses this (Metal) look and feel.

</p>

<p>
Change log:

<ul>
<li> 0.2 - Several bug fixes. Some add/delete operations in PTBTreeNode/PDTBNode were buggy. The tree canvas had some erroneous behaviour during mutation and when an expansion state isn't maintained. </li>
<li> 0.2.1 - Bug fixes in PDTBXPath. Connectives weren't being sorted on output. Added a regexp function for PDTBXPath. </li>
<li> 0.2.2 - Fixed a minor bug in the raw text attribute, an extra space was being prepended. Optimizations to the Penn Treebank 
portion of the API. It is now 2-3 times faster. The convenience classes:
<code> edu.upenn.cis.pdtb.util.PDTBTask</code> and <code> edu.upenn.cis.ptb.util.PTBTask</code> should simplify basic access
patterns. Some example XPath queries are given <a href="#pdtbxpath">below</a>. </li>
<li> 0.2.3 - Some more optimizations, with a two-fold speedup on the PTB side. Some syntactic sugar for the XPath queries, and
a little bit of documentation on how to <a href="lpath.html">query the PTB</a>. The queries are now (perhaps) fast enough to be
useful. Query times are discussed <a href="#xpathsupport">here</a>.</li>
<li> 0.2.4 - Browser bug on Macs fixed. It seems to be a java problem, rather than one with our code base. The browser uses
the Metal look and feel now. See note above to fix it without upgrading. </li>
<li> 0.2.5 - Some extensions to the PDTBXPath tool, described <a href="xpathextensions.html">here</a>. Regression fixes to 
<code>edu.upenn.cis.pdtb.xpath.PDTBNavigator</code> and <code>edu.upenn.cis.ptb.xpath.PTBNavigator</code></li>
<li> 0.2.6 - Added the ability to cache XPath subexpressions on the PDTB, described <a href="xpathextensions.html">here</a>. Makes
the extensions defined in 0.2.5 more efficient.</li>
<li> 0.2.7 - Fixed a  bug in <code> edu.upenn.cis.ptb.util.CorpusFileIterator </code>. Used to cause an exception when the 
Propbank parsed 
<code>.cmb</code> files appear under PtbRoot. Added <code>Prev</code> and <code>Next</code> buttons to the browser.</code>
<li> 0.2.8 - Added XPath functions to group explicit connectives into subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions and
adverbials. Described <a href="xpathextensions.html">here</a>. A bug in the regex for subordinating conjunctions was fixed on
03-27-2007 (not worth a new version number).</li>
<li> 0.2.9 - Some of the span comparison functions were too rigid and crossing was incorrectly defined. Added functionality
to state more approximate versions of span queries and corrected crossing. Added a split mode to the browser to compare
connectives in the same discourse. </li>
</ul>

<a id="browser"><H5>The Browser</H5></a>

<a href="pdtbbrowser.jnlp">Launch the PDTB Browser</a> via Java Web Start.
<p>
A screenshot of the browser (parse trees on the top, PDTB annotations
bottom left, and the raw text on the bottom right) is given below. Arg1 is 
highlighted in yellow, Arg2 in blue, the connective in red, and the features 
associated with the connective can be seen on the bottom left.
</p>

<p>
The bottom left window can be used to select connectives and arguments. Clicking
on a connective shows the features associated. Double clicking toggles between
showing and hiding the arguments. Clicking on an argument will show the features.
The spans associated with attribution will be added in the second release of the PDTB, 
and so clicking on the features has no effect.
</p>

<p>
Nodes in the parse tree can
be collapsed for viewing without scrolling. For example, the PP-LOC 
node in Arg1 (in yellow) has been collapsed. Clicking on a parse tree node 
toggles between expanding and collapsing. 
</p>


<p>
The combo boxes (drop down lists) in the middle
correspond to the section and file numbers (on the left and right respectively). Only files under
PdtbRoot, which have associated files in PtbRoot, and RawRoot can be loaded 
(the boxes will let you select only valid files). These are supplied as
commandline arguments as mentioned above. When the Load button is
clicked the files correponding to the section and file numbers selected in the
combo boxes are loaded as a tab. The Close Tab button closes the tab currently
in focus.
</p>

<p>
The buttons Prev and Next switch to the previous and next files (if any) from the file denoted by
the combo boxes. These buttons were added in v0.2.7.
</p>


<p>
The button New Query brings up a <a href="query.html">Query Window</a>, allowing you to build a PDTBXPath search on the entire corpus.

<a id="xpathsupport"><H5> XPath Support </H5></a>

The API supports 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a> queries on the PDTB 
annotations, and PTB annotations independently. For joint queries one needs to 
query the PDTB, and use the results to query the PTB. XPath support is 
achieved via 
<a href="http://jaxen.sourceforge.net">Jaxen</a> (Jaxen is bundled with the distributions
and a separate download is not required).
</p>

<p>
This is not intended as a replacement for tgrep, or various other query tools
written for the PTB. The mechanisms used here are significantly slower, 
as each file will have to be queried independently. The advantage that this API offers 
is a more accessible programming model.
</p>

<p>
As of v0.2.3, the query
speeds are about 4 times faster on average. The following queries
were run (v0.2.3) on a machine with an Intel Pentium4 (at 2.4GHz, 1G memory) 
processor, running Suse Linux (total counts of results were produced):

<OL>
<LI>
<code>>::ExplicitRelation[@connHead='because']</code> (3secs without loading syntax, vmflags: -Xmx300M -Xms300M). This
is equivalent to the XPath query <code>child::ExplicitRelation[@connHead='because']</code>
</LI>
<LI>
<code> =>>::S/>::NP[->::VP]</code> (7secs, vmflags: -Xmx300M -Xms300M). This is equivalent to the XPath query
<code>descendant-or-self::S/child::NP[following::VP]</code>
</LI>
</OL>

We tested on 23 PTB queries (in the <a href="http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/QLDB/lpath3.pdf">Bird et al.</a> paper), and 
they take between 6-12secs. There is an implementation of Bird et al.'s
extensions to XPath, and it is described briefly <a href="lpath.html">here</a>. We do not have a command line
XPath interface to the PTB yet, some interface work is needed to facilitate browsing results. Contributions
welcome. The command line XPath tool for the PDTB, and the syntactic sugar used are described <a href="#pdtbxpath">below</a>.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="docs/index.html">API docs</a> 
of the following packages for more info:

<pre>
edu.upenn.cis.pdtb.xpath and edu.upenn.cis.ptb.xpath
</pre>

</p>

<p>
<a id="pdtbxpath"><H5>PDTBXPath</H5></a>

 A simple top level query interface to the PDTB (examples are given toward the bottom of the
page). Usage is as follows:
 
 <pre>
   cd PDTBUser
   java -Xmx300M -Xms300M -classpath "pdtb.jar" edu.upenn.cis.pdtb.xpath.PDTBXPath args
 </pre>
 
 The arguments are as follows:
 
 <pre>
   --rawRoot RawRoot (or -r RawRoot)
   --ptbRoot PtbRoot (or -p PtbRoot)
   --pdtbRoot PdtbRoot (or -d PdtbRoot)
   --outputRoot OutputRoot (or -o OutputRoot. This will serve as the result PdtbRoot.
                            OutputRoot should not exist when this is run)
   --xpath XPathExpression (or -x XPathExpression)
   -c (generates total counts in addition to the files)
   -b (opens results in the browser. The saved results can always be opened in
       the browser at a later time, by specifying OutputRoot as the PdtbRoot 
       argument to the browser.)
  </pre>

<p>
Or modify <a href="run_query.txt">this Perl script</a> appropriately, and place it
in the PDTBUser directory. Here is <a href="query_test.txt">another Perl script</a> with
example queries, and <a href="xpath.pdf"> some slides </a> explaining the overall design.
These files use the standard XPath syntax.
</p>

<p>
We have added extensions to XPath specific to the PDTB. Since this a growing list, we
have moved it to a separate <a href="xpathextensions.html"> PDTB XPath Extensions</a> page.
Scripts containing example queries are now part of <a href="pdtbuser.zip"> the user distribution</a>.
</p>

<p>
Users unfamiliar with Java should go 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/">here</a> for a 
tutorial on how to run Java programs. The most common error is setting the classpath wrong, 
which results in output of the form: 
</p>

 <pre>
  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: edu.upenn.cis.pdtb.xpath.PDTBXPath
 </pre> 

<p>
Please make sure that the classpath includes the "pdtb.jar" file in the PDTBUser directory.
That is if you run the command from a directory other than PDTBUser the option should be
specified as <EM> -classpath "....path to...pdtb.jar" </EM>.
</p>

<p>
The XPath expression should select Element nodes listed below. If any other kind of node or 
object is returned by the query, the program exits. The full XPath functionality can be 
accessed via the API. The following is the list of Elements, their children, and attributes:

</p> 
  <TABLE border="1">

  <TR>
  <TD>Sup2</TD>
  <TD></TD>
  <TD>rawText</TD>
  </TR>
 
   </TABLE>
 
  <p>
   Note that the Source, Type, Polarity, and Det attributes appear on all 
   arguments except those of EntityRelation and NoRelation.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  The expression <code>"//ExplicitRelation[@connHead='because']"</code> selects
  all occurences of the explicit connective "because". The expression
  <code>"//ImplicitRelation[@conn1='instead']"</code> selects all implicit relations
  where "instead" is chosen as conn1. Note that the enclosing quotes are necessary on
  the command line.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  If an Element is selected by an expression, the closest ancestor (or the node
   itself) which is a child of PDTBRelationList will be output. This is so that the
  results can be loaded in the browser. If the -c option is specified total counts of
  the number of objects selected is produced. This will usually be greater than or equal to the number
  of relations saved in the OutputRoot.
  </p>
 
  <p>
   Here is a sample command line invocation for the Bourne shell:
 
   <pre>
     cd PDTBUser
     java -Xmx300M -Xms300M -classpath "pdtb.jar" edu.upenn.cis.pdtb.xpath.PDTBXPath \
             -r Corpora/PTB/raw/wsj \
             -p Corpora/PTB/combined/wsj \
             -d Corpora/PDTB/pdtb/wsj \
             -o Corpora/PDTB/PDTBImplicitBecause \
             -x "//ImplicitRelation[@conn1 = 'because']" -c -b
    </pre>
 
  Note that the output directory specified by -o, should not exist prior to
  invocation. 
 
  </p>
 
  <p>
 
  See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a> recommendation for further
  info on XPath. For querying the syntax as well, use the API.
